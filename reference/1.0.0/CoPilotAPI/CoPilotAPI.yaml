        To authenticate any request to the CoPilot API, you must first request an access token using the Token endpoint. The Token endpoint requires CoPilot user account credentials, and returns the access token you will use to make API requests during a session.

        The access token is valid for a limited timeframe, indicated by the expires_in value (in seconds). Once a token has expired, you must request a new token.

        Supply the access_token value in the Authorization header of your subsequent API calls, using the Bearer Authentication scheme as shown below.

        <code>Authorization: Bearer <access_token></code>
        
        **Important Security Considerations**:
        
        * The provided client_secret is a secret and should never be exposed on the client side via JavaScript. Ensure that the client secret is stored securely in your application.
        * Do not expose the access_token or refresh_token in client-side applications.
        * Create a dedicated CoPilot user account for authenticating your CoPilot API requests, and do not use this account to access the CoPilot web application. Using this account to access the CoPilot web application will initiate the two-factor authentication (2FA) requirement for this account, preventing the authentication of your API requests until the 2FA requirement is satisfied.

        The Merchant endpoint is used primarily to create a new merchant account in CoPilot, using a pre-existing application template that has been created in the CoPilot web interface.
        Once the merchant account has been created, additional boarding operations can be performed, such as:

        Ordering equipment for the account
        Uploading attachments that the merchant has completed and signed
        Requesting a digital signature from the merchant, allowing them to review and sign the application using their web browser
        Use the POST method to create a new merchant account using a pre-existing application template that has been created in the CoPilot web interface. A successful request returns the merchantId property, which is used to identify the account within CoPilot and is used in subsequent API calls for additional boarding operations.
        The code example to the right is not representative of a legitimate request as it includes all possible fields, including those that would generate a conflict when creating a merchant.

        See the CoPilot Developer Guides to learn about the minimum data requirements and process of creating a new merchant.

Once a merchant account has been created, use the PUT method to update any account data prior to submitting for digital signing by the merchant.
        
        Updating merchant data is only possible when the account has not yet been submitted for digital signature. Use the Get Merchant Status endpoint to verify that the boardingProcessStatusCd is INPROG. If the boardingProcessStatusCd is OFS, then the account has been submitted for digital signature but has not yet been signed. If that is the case, you must use the Retract Signature endpoint before modifying any account data.

        This method can only be used when the application is pending signature. Use Get Signature Status to verify that the current signature status is PENDING, which indicates that the application has been submitted to the owner for signing, but has not yet been signed.
        
        After updating the account data, use Request Signature to generate a new unique URL that the owner will use to review and sign the digital application.
