        This can be useful for merchants with multiple terminal models, to determine which supports signature capture or receipt printing, or for merchants with multiple locations, who need to determine which terminals are associated with each merchant ID.

        The <code>preconnect</code> endpoint initiates a two-factor authentication process between the terminal and the terminal service. a successful response displays a 6 character alpha-numeric token on the terminal, which must then be used to make a connect request to establish a session with the terminal service. The token displays for 60 seconds (configurable), or until a successful connect request is made. 

        To use this feature, two-factor authentication must be enabled for the merchant. Note that two-factor authentication is required when it is enabled.

        * The preconnect endpoint is currently <bold>NOT</bold> supported for Clover terminals.

      description: |
        A call to the <code>connect</code> endpoint establishes a session between the terminal and the terminal service. The response returns a session key to use in subsequent requests to the terminal.

        For example, if the response header returns 

        <bold>X-CardConnect-SessionKey →f4fb39ff5c9c4299b3d7b34ca7ce2348;expires=2018-09-25T16:26:48.482Z</bold>

        Then each subsequent request header must be:

        <bold>X-CardConnect-SessionKey: f4fb39ff5c9c4299b3d7b34ca7ce2348</bold>

        If you use the <code>preconnect</code> endpoint to obtain an authorization token for two-factor authentication, you must also include the token in the <code>connect</code> request.
        
        If force is set to true, any existing sessions will be destroyed and all in-flight operations on the terminal will be cancelled. The force parameter is optional and defaults to false.
        
        See Establishing a Session for more information.
        
        Once the session is complete, call the disconnect endpoint to end the session. Otherwise, the session key will expire at the the ISO-8601 expiration timestamp included in the initial connect response.

        On a Clover terminal, sending either a single or multi-line message replaces the idle image with the message, along with the logo image (if one is configured for the device).
        
        On an Ingenico terminal:
        
        Sending a single-line string displays the text in the display footer area, retaining the idle image.
        
        Sending a multi-line string displays the text in the primary display area, replacing the idle image.
        
        Additionally, you can send a blank string, which clears any existing prompts and returns the terminal display to an idle state. You can also call the clearDisplay endpoint to clear the terminal display.
        
        * For Ingenico terminals, to include a percent sign (%) in the display text, you must include two percent signs (%%) in the request. If you include a single percent sign, the terminal will display an unexpected message string.

        If you use the cancel command to allow a merchant or cardholder to attempt to cancel a transaction in progress, you should also use the CardPointe Gateway API's <code>inquireByOrderid</code> request to verify the status of the transaction. A transaction cannot be canceled if the terminal service has already initiated the authorization request to the CardPointe Gateway; however, you can use the <code>inquireByOrderid</code> request to check the status of the transaction and void if necessary.

If no order ID is specified in the request, the terminal automatically generates a unique order ID in the format <HSN-timestamp> and amends it to the transaction record.

            You can use the order ID to get information on a transaction using the CardPointe Gateway API inquireByOrderid endpoint.

            Additionally, when an authorization attempt times out and the terminal service does not receive a response from the CardPointe Gateway, the terminal service uses the order ID to make an <code>inquireByOrderid</code> request to check the status of the transaction. If the transaction status cannot be determined, the terminal service makes three <code>voidByorderId</code> requests to void the transaction. Review the Handling Timeouts section in the <a href="../docs/?path=docs/APIs/CardPointeIntegratedTerminalAPI.md&branch=develop">CardPointe Integrated Terminal Developer Guides</a> for more information.

            **Note**: If you include an order ID it must meet the following requirements: 

            * The order ID must be a unique value. Using duplicate order IDs can lead to the wrong transaction being voided in the event of a timeout.
            
            * The order ID must not include any portion of a payment account number (PAN), and no portion of the order ID should be mistaken for a PAN. If the order ID passes the Luhn check performed by the CardPointe Gateway, the value will be masked in the database, and attempts to use the order ID in an inquire, void, or refund request will fail.

        printDelay:
          description: |
            For Clover terminals, specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before printing generating and printing a second receipt, when "printExtraReceipt":"true". On average, this process takes approximately 5 seconds (5000 ms), therefore the total amount of time to print a second receipt is equal to the printDelay value + 5000ms.

            Valid values range from 0 to 60000 (ms).

            **Notes**:

            * <code>printDelay</code> is required when <code>"printExtraReceipt":"true"</code>; otherwise, the response returns the following error:

            <code>{"errorCode":1,"errorMessage":"printDelay is a required parameter when printExtraReceipt=true"}</code>

            * If <code>printDelay</code> is set to a value outside of the allowed range, the response returns the following error:

            <code>{"errorCode":3,"errorMessage":"'printDelay' value must be between 0 and 60,000"}</code>

        orderId:
          description: |
            A unique order ID used to identify the transaction. This value is an alphanumeric string with a maximum of 50 characters. If no order ID is specified in the request, the terminal automatically generates a unique order ID in the format <HSN-timestamp> and amends it to the transaction record.

            You can use the order ID to get information on a transaction using the CardPointe Gateway API inquireByOrderid endpoint.

            Additionally, when an authorization attempt times out and the terminal service does not receive a response from the CardPointe Gateway, the terminal service uses the order ID to make an <code>inquireByOrderid</code> request to check the status of the transaction. If the transaction status cannot be determined, the terminal service makes three <code>voidByorderId</code> requests to void the transaction. Review the Handling Timeouts section in the <a href="https://qa-developerstudio.fiserv.com/product/CardPointe/docs/?path=docs/documentation/CardPointeIntegratedTerminalDeveloperGuides.md&branch=develop">CardPointe Integrated Terminal Developer Guides</a> for more information.

            **Note**: If you include an order ID it must meet the following requirements: 

            * The order ID must be a unique value. Using duplicate order IDs can lead to the wrong transaction being voided in the event of a timeout.
            
            * The order ID must not include any portion of a payment account number (PAN), and no portion of the order ID should be mistaken for a PAN. If the order ID passes the Luhn check performed by the CardPointe Gateway, the value will be masked in the database, and attempts to use the order ID in an inquire, void, or refund request will fail.

            For Clover terminals, specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait before printing generating and printing a second receipt, when "printExtraReceipt":"true". On average, this process takes approximately 5 seconds (5000 ms), therefore the total amount of time to print a second receipt is equal to the printDelay value + 5000ms.

            Valid values range from 0 to 60000 (ms).

            **Notes**:

            * <code>printDelay</code> is required when <code>"printExtraReceipt":"true"</code>; otherwise, the response returns the following error:

            <code>{"errorCode":1,"errorMessage":"printDelay is a required parameter when printExtraReceipt=true"}</code>

            * If <code>printDelay</code> is set to a value outside of the allowed range, the response returns the following error:

            <code>{"errorCode":3,"errorMessage":"'printDelay' value must be between 0 and 60,000"}</code>
