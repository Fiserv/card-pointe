      description: |+
        A GET request to the inquireMerchant endpoint returns information on the merchant account configuration. This can be helpful for partners who need to validate their CardPointe merchant IDs or for businesses with merchants operating in multiple locations, to ensure that the merchant ID is boarded to the correct site.

      summary: The surcharge endpoint is used to determine whether a surcharge fee will be applied to a transaction, based on the cardholder's postal code and payment method.
      description: |+ 
        The surcharge endpoint is used to determine whether or not a surcharge fee will be   applied to a transaction, based on the cardholder's postal code and payment method. This allows your application to notify the cardholder of the potential credit card surcharge prior to completing a transaction.
        
        This request does not effect whether a surcharge is applied to a transaction; the CardPointe Gateway automatically applies a surcharge depending on the merchant configuration and the eligibility of the payment account. This request is used only for informational purposes.

        Authorization is the initial step in accepting payment from a cardholder. This action "authorizes" or requests permission from the bank to transfer money from the cardholder to the merchant.

        The authorization service supports a <code>PUT</code> or <code>POST</code> request that includes a JSON encoded list of fields defined for the service. The service responds with either an HTTP Exception, if there are errors, or a JSON-encoded response, if the request was successful.

        Within the response, the status of the transaction is described in the respstat value:

        The void service cancels a transaction that is in either "Authorized" or "Queued for Capture" status.

        Partial voids are not supported for debit transactions. If you specify a partial void amount for a debit transaction, the entire amount is voided. Omit the amount or specify the full amount for a debit void.

        You can retrieve the status of a transaction using the inquire or inquireByOrderid endpoint. 

        The response includes a voidable field, which indicates whether or not the transaction can be voided.

        The setlstatfield in determines the amount that can be voided, where:

        "setlstat" : "Authorized"
        This status indicates the transaction has been authorized but not queued for capture. The entire amount or a partial amount can be voided.
        "setlstat" : "Queued for Capture"
        Only the entire amount can be voided.

        The refund service is used for transactions that are in a settled status.
        
        <code>merchid</code> and <code>retref</code> are required fields.

        You can refund a specific transaction using the retrieval reference number <code>retref</code> provided in the authorization response. 
        
        You can retrieve the status of a transaction using the <a href="https://developerstudio.fiserv.com/product/CardPointe/api/?type=get&path=/cardconnect/rest/inquire">inquire</a> or <a href="https://developerstudio.fiserv.com/product/CardPointe/api/?type=get&path=/cardconnect/rest/inquireByOrderid">inquireByOrderid</a> endpoint.

        The response includes a <code>refundable</code> field, which indicates whether or not the transaction can be refunded.

        The specific transaction status is recorded in the <code>setlstat</code> field.
        
        Some banks impose maximum time limits (for example, 6 months) to perform a refund using a retref. 

        If you do not have a retref for the transaction, you can return funds to an account by passing a negative <code>amount</code> (forced credit) in an authorization and subsequent capture request.

        * 1 - Issuer Will Never Approve.

        In this case, the merchant should never reattempt to authorize the transaction, and the cardholder must provide an alternate payment method. This code can be returned for accounts that are blocked, never existed, or are otherwise flagged as invalid by the issuer.

        * 3 - Issuer Cannot Approve Based on Details Provided.

        In this case, the card has been declined due to incorrect data, such as the CVV, expiry, or PIN. The merchant may attempt the authorization, after obtaining the corrected data.
