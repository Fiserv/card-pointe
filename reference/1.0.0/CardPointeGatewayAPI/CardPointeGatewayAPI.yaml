        A GET request to the inquireMerchant endpoint returns information on the merchant account configuration. This can be helpful for partners who need to validate their CardPointe merchant IDs or for businesses with merchants operating in multiple locations, to ensure that the merchant ID is boarded to the correct site.

      summary: The surcharge endpoint is used to determine whether a surcharge fee will be applied to a transaction, based on the cardholder's postal code and payment method.
      description: |+ 
        The surcharge endpoint is used to determine whether or not a surcharge fee will be applied to a transaction, based on the cardholder's postal code and payment method. This allows your application to notify the cardholder of the potential credit card surcharge prior to completing a transaction. Optionally, include the subtotal amount to return the calculated surcharge amount, if applicable.
        
        This request does not effect whether a surcharge is applied to a transaction; the CardPointe Gateway automatically applies a surcharge depending on the merchant configuration and the eligibility of the payment account. This request is used only for informational purposes.
        
        The surcharge endpoint requires a query string formatted as <code>https://{site}.cardconnect.com/rest/surcharge?amount={amount}&merchid={merchid}&token={token}&postal={postal}&amount={amount}</code>.

      description: | 
        The void endpoint cancels a transaction that is in either <code>"Authorized"</code> or <code>"Queued for Capture"</code> status.

        Partial voids are not supported for debit transactions. If you specify a partial void amount for a debit transaction, the entire amount is voided. Omit the amount or specify the full amount for a debit void.

        You can retrieve the status of a transaction using the [inquire](../api/?type=get&path=/cardconnect/rest/inquire) or [inquireByOrderid](../api/?type=get&path=/cardconnect/rest/inquireByOrderid/{merchid}/{orderid}/{set}) endpoint. 

        The response includes a <code>voidable</code> field, which indicates whether or not the transaction can be voided.

        Additionally, the <code>setlstat</code> field determines the amount that can be voided, where:

        <code>"setlstat" : "Authorized"</code> indicates the transaction has been authorized but not queued for capture. The entire amount or a partial amount can be voided.
        <code>"setlstat" : "Queued for Capture"</code>
        Only the entire amount can be voided.

        The refund endpoint is used to refund transactions that are in a settled status.
        
        <code>merchid</code> and <code>retref</code> are required fields.

        You can refund a specific transaction using the retrieval reference number <code>retref</code> provided in the authorization response. 
        
        You can retrieve the status of a transaction using the <code>inquire</code> or <code>inquireByOrderid</code> endpoint.

        The response includes a <code>refundable</code> field, which indicates whether or not the transaction can be refunded.

        The specific transaction status is recorded in the <code>setlstat</code> field.
        
        Some banks impose maximum time limits (for example, 6 months) to perform a refund using a retref. 

        If you do not have a retref for the transaction, you can return funds to an account by passing a negative <code>amount</code> (forced credit) in an authorization and subsequent capture request.

        If you have multiple MIDs and do not know which MID was used in the original transaction, you can omit the set parameter from the end of the request to optionally inquire on the order ID across all MIDs on the site.

      summary: The voidByOrderId endpoint is used to look up and void a transaction record using the order ID supplied in the original authorization request.

        The voidByOrderId endpoint is used to look up and void a transaction record using the order ID supplied in the original authorization request. If the order ID supplied in a voidByOrderId request matches a transaction record for the specified merchant, the authorization is voided and a response is returned.

        voidByOrderId can be used in the event that no response is returned by an inquireByOrderId request, when you are unsure of a transaction's status. It's recommended to call voidByOrderId three times (3x) if no response was returned by either an inquireByOrderid request or the initial auth request.
        
        Partial voids are not supported for debit transactions. If you specify a partial void amount for a debit transaction, the entire amount is voided. Omit the amount or specify the full amount for a debit void.
        
        It is strongly recommended that you use a unique order ID for every transaction, if you are using order IDs. Doing so allows you to more easily and accurately retrieve data on all transactions.

        The funding endpoint provides merchant funding information and supplemental transaction and funding adjustment details. This information is provided by the host payment processing platform (for example, First Data Omaha). 
        
        The funding endpoint requires a query string formatted as <code>https://{site}.cardconnect.com/rest/funding?merchid={merchid}&date={MMDD}</code>or<code>{YYYYMMDD}</code>, where <code>merchid</code> is the merchant account for which you want to retrieve funding data.
         
        Funding data is only available for merchants with the funding service configured and enabled in the production environment.
        
        For merchants with next day funding, funding data is typically available between 1PM and 6PM ET on the day following settlement. 
        
        For merchants without next day funding, funding data is typically available within 1-2 business days between 1PM and 6PM ET.
        
        Profitstars ACH funding data is typically available within 72 hours.
        
        A request to the funding endpoint returns all available funding data for the merchant on the date specified, in an array of fundings, txns (transactions), adjustments, and chargebacks records. If no adjustment or chargeback data is present for the date specified, these arrays are not returned.
        
        If no batches are found or are ready to return, the service returns

        <code>{"errormsg":"No deposits match your request"}</code>.

        **merchid**, **account**, and **expiry** are required fields.

        In addition to the profile create and use features of the authorization service, the Profile services provides an independent method to create, update/replace, retrieve and delete a profile.
        
        A create or update request is made including the fields below (the same fields marked with asterisk in the authorization request). The service tokenizes the account property and creates the profile with a token and profile ID and optional account ID. One account ID in each profile can be marked as the default account. The default account will be used for all authorization requests when only the profile ID is supplied. If an account ID is present the service retrieves the existing profile and updates it, or returns profile not found.
      
        A PUT or POST call to the profile endpoint creates a new profile or adds a new account to an existing profile. 

        The service tokenizes the account property and creates the profile with a token and profile ID and optional account ID. If the profile includes multiple accounts, one account ID in the profile can be marked as the default account by setting the defaultacct parameter to "Y." The default account will be used for all authorization requests when only the profile ID is supplied. 
        
        In addition to creating a new profile, you can use this service to do the following:
        
        To update a profile, include an existing profile ID in the request. The service retrieves the existing profile and updates it with the values in the request. 
        To update an account, include an existing profile ID and account ID pair in the request. The service retrieves the existing account data and updates it with the values in the request.
        To add an account to an existing profile, include an existing profile ID and the new payment account data in the request. The service retrieves the existing profile and adds a new acctid containing the values in the request.
        
        If you attempt to create a new profile that exactly matches an existing profile, the new profile will not be created; instead the response includes the profileid and acctid for the existing profile.

        The following fields are checked for matches, and if all of the following fields match an existing profile, the new profile is not created:
        
        * merchid
        * token

        * auoptout
        If the request includes "defaultacct":"Y", the CardPointe Gateway will update the existing profile to set it as the default, and will return the existing profileid and acctid info in the response.

           The payment account to process the transaction. Can be one of the following:
          
           - CardSecure Token - A token representing the payment account number. See the CardSecure Developer Guide for more information.
           
           - Clear text card number - Only PCI Level 1 and Level 2 compliant merchants should handle clear text card numbers in authorization requests. It is *strongly recommended* that you tokenize the clear text card data before passing it in an authorization request.
           
           - Bank Account Number - For merchants configured to process electronic checking (ACH) transactions. Also requires <code>bankaba</code>. 
           
           See Processing ACH Payments for more information.
        amount:
          maxLength: 14

           Amount with decimal or without decimal in currency minor units (for example, USD Pennies or EUR Cents).
           
           The value can be a positive or negative amount or 0, and is used to identify the type of authorization, as follows:
           
           - Positive - Authorization request.
           - Zero - Account Verification request. Not supported for eCheck (ACH) authorizations.
           - Negative - Refund without reference (Forced Credit). Merchants must be configured to process forced credit transactions. To refund anexisting authorization, use Refund.

         description: |
            An optional, unique order ID for the transaction, generated by the source system.  
            
            Order IDs must be unique; using duplicate order IDs can lead to the wrong transaction being voided in the event of a timeout.
            
            The order ID must not include any portion of a payment account number (PAN), and no portion of the order ID should be mistaken for a PAN. If the order ID passes the Luhn check performed by the CardPointe Gateway, the value will be masked in the database, and attempts to use the order ID in an inquire, void, or refund request will fail.
        postal:
         maxLength: 9
         type: string
         example: "19046"
         description: | 
          The account holder's postal code for address verification service (AVS) verification. Also used to determine surcharge eligibility for merchants configured for surcharging. 
        
          If country is "US", must be 5 or 9 digits. Otherwise any alphanumeric string is accepted. Defaults to"55555" if not included in the request or stored profile. 
        
          It is strongly recommended that your application prompts for postal code for card-not-present transactions, to prevent fraud and downgrades, and to avoid declines on the CardPointe Gateway if the AVS verification option is enabled for your merchant account.

        Note: If you include an order ID it must meet the following requirements:
        
        - The order ID must be a unique value. Using duplicate order IDs can lead to the wrong transaction being voided in the event of a timeout.
        - The order ID must not include any portion of a payment account number (PAN), and no portion of the order ID should be mistaken for a PAN. If the order ID passes the Luhn check performed by the CardPointe Gateway, the value will be masked in the database, and attempts to use the order ID in an inquire, void, or refund request will fail.

        One of the following values:

        * 1 - Issuer Will Never Approve.

        In this case, the merchant should never reattempt to authorize the transaction, and the cardholder must provide an alternate payment method. This code can be returned for accounts that are blocked, never existed, or are otherwise flagged as invalid by the issuer.

        * 2 - Issuer Cannot Approve at this Time.

        In this case, the merchant may reattempt the authorization at a later time. Reasons for this decline can include velocity controls, credit risk holds, or system errors.

        Note: You may reattempt this transaction a maximum of 15 times in a 30-day period before incurring excessive reattempt fees, unless you receive an updated declineCategory of 1, in which case you should no longer reattempt this transaction.

        * 3 - Issuer Cannot Approve Based on Details Provided.

        In this case, the card has been declined due to incorrect data, such as the CVV, expiry, or PIN. The merchant may attempt the authorization, after obtaining the corrected data.

        Note: You may reattempt this transaction a maximum of 15 times in a 30-day period before incurring excessive reattempt fees, unless you receive an updated declineCategory of 1, in which case you should no longer reattempt this transaction.

        * <code>Fix the request and retry</code> - Returned for declineCategory 3.

        * Queued for Capture - The authorization was approved and captured but has not yet been sent for settlement.
        * Voided - The authorization was voided; therefore, the transaction cannot be captured.

    userfields:

      description: |+
        You can include additional data in the authorization request for future retrieval by using optional userfields. The value of the userfields object is a series of name-value pairs that are meaningful to the merchant. 

        You can use an array or an object.
        
        The name and value fields can include any string value, and you can include as many fields as necessary; however, the total length of user defined fields, URL/JSON encoded, is limited to 4000 bytes, where 1 character is equal to 1 byte. 
        
        If you use the CardPointe web application for transaction reporting, you must ensure that you pass your custom fields in an array, in the order that they are configured in the CardPointe application to ensure that the fields are populated correctly in the Transactions table. If there is no value for a field, you must include the field with an empty value (for example, "udf1":"") to preserve the expected order of the fields. If you pass the fields in an object, the order will not be preserved.
        
        While the example is a JSON array, a JSON object version of userfields is also available.
