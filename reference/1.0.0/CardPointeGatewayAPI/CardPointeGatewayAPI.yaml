        A GET request to the inquireMerchant endpoint returns information on the merchant account configuration. This can be helpful for partners who need to validate their CardPointe merchant IDs or for businesses with merchants operating in multiple locations, to ensure that the merchant ID is boarded to the correct site.

      summary: The surcharge endpoint is used to determine whether a surcharge fee will be applied to a transaction, based on the cardholder's postal code and payment method.
      description: |+ 
        The surcharge endpoint is used to determine whether or not a surcharge fee will be   applied to a transaction, based on the cardholder's postal code and payment method. This allows your application to notify the cardholder of the potential credit card surcharge prior to completing a transaction.
        
        This request does not effect whether a surcharge is applied to a transaction; the CardPointe Gateway automatically applies a surcharge depending on the merchant configuration and the eligibility of the payment account. This request is used only for informational purposes.

        Authorization is the initial step in accepting payment from a cardholder. This action "authorizes" or requests permission from the bank to transfer money from the cardholder to the merchant.

        The authorization service supports a <code>PUT</code> or <code>POST</code> request that includes a JSON encoded list of fields defined for the service. The service responds with either an HTTP Exception, if there are errors, or a JSON-encoded response, if the request was successful.

        Within the response, the status of the transaction is described in the respstat value:
