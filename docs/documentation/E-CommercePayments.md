# Overview

E-commerce payments make up the largest volume of card-not-present transactions. This guide provides information on important requirements and best practices for accepting e-commerce payments and card-not-present payments in general, as well as information on getting started with various CardPointe e-commerce solutions.

Before you begin your integration, you should review the information in this guide to help plan and guide your development.

# What is E-Commerce?

E-commerce, short for electronic commerce, is a term used to describe payments accepted remotely over the internet. Similarly to a MOTO (mail order/telephone order) transaction, in an e-commerce transaction, the customer and their payment card are not physically present at the time of sale. Instead, the customer interacts with a mobile application, online checkout form, or other means of entering their payment information to complete a transaction.

Unlike card-present transactions, in which a secure payment terminal or card reader encrypts and transmits the payment data at the point-of-sale, e-commerce payments require additional layers of security to comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). See the CardPointe E-commerce Solutions section below for detailed information on how our e-commerce solutions ensure the safety of your customers' data.

By building a safe, convenient, and user-friendly e-commerce experience, you can increase your customer base and rate of return customers. Additionally, the CardPointe platform's tokens (generated by CardSecure) support omnichannel payments, allowing your customers to move seamlessly between your card-present and card-not-present experiences.

# E-Commerce Requirements

The CardPointe Gateway is certified for compliance with the latest payment industry standards and requirements to help your business remain compliant while giving support tools to aid in protecting your cardholder's data.

Consider the following industry standards and requirements for accepting e-commerce payments:

- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards**

      CardSecure is the CardPointe Gateway's sensitive data encryption and tokenization service. CardSecure allows you to securely accept and tokenize payment card, ACH   (eCheck), and mobile wallet data to ensure the safety of your customers' sensitive payment data. CardSecure and the CardPointe Gateway offer simple solutions to ensure that sensitive cardholder data is never exposed to your application or systems, helping to reduce your scope of PCI compliance.

      See the PCI Council's Best Practices for Securing E-commerce for helpful information, and see the Council's official Document Library for additional resources.

- **Visa and Mastercard Stored Credential Transaction Framework Mandate**

      This mandate also referred to as credentials on file, card on file, or COF, requires merchants storing cardholder data to gain consent and to properly identify all transactions using stored data. See the Visa and Mastercard Stored Credential Transaction Framework Mandate guide for detailed information and requirements.

- **3-D Secure**

      3-D Secure is a required protocol to accept e-commerce payments for merchants in the European Union, India, and Australia, among other countries and supranational institutions. 3DS was developed by the card brands and EMVCo to provide additional cardholder security for e-commerce credit and debit card transactions. It is EMVCo's standard for securing e-commerce payments to comply with the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) mandate in the European Union. If you are located outside of the USA, it is recommended you check your national requirements for accepting e-commerce payments. To enable merchants to comply with this mandate, the CardPointe Gateway supports 3-D Secure 2.0. See the 3-D Secure 2.0 guide for detailed information and technical requirements.
