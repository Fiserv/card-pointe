# Hosted iFrame Tokenizer

The Hosted iFrame Tokenizer helps to reduce your Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS) audit scope by providing a secure iframe that can be embedded in your online checkout page to accept and transmit sensitive payment data to [CardSecure](?path=docs/documentation/CardSecure.md) for tokenization.

## Date Updated: 11/8/2023 

An update to the Hosted iFrame Tokenizer was deployed to the UAT environment on 11/2/2023 with an additional fix deployed to UAT on 11/7/2023. These updates were then deployed to the Production environment on 11/9/2023. 

This release of the Hosted iFrame Tokenizer includes backend fixes and enhancements, in addition to the following update:

### Fix for Orientation 

An issue that caused the orientation to not align with the set parameter was fixed. This setting now functions as expected. 

# Understanding the Hosted iFrame Tokenizer

The Hosted iFrame Tokenizer is a secure, hosted web form that contains the input fields necessary for your site visitors to enter their sensitive payment data. This page is incorporated into your own web page using an HTML iframe element.

Your site visitors enter sensitive payment data into the fields of the embedded iframe and this data is then passed securely to CardSecure for tokenization. The tokenized value generated by CardSecure is returned to your web page through the iframe, and is not considered sensitive in nature. You may store this token and use it in a subsequent call to the CardPointe Gateway to process the payment.

The following diagram illustrates the Hosted iFrame Tokenizer data flow at a high level:

## Implementation Examples

The following examples illustrate various sample implementations of the Hosted iFrame Tokenizer. Click the links in the table below to preview each example. The default implementation, with no optional parameters, includes only the Card Number field used to tokenize the payment account. 

The Hosted iFrame Tokenizer supports optional parameters to gather additional details for processing payments using the [CardPointe Gateway API](?path=docs/APIs/CardPointeGatewayAPI.md) (for example, expiration and CVV) as well as to customize the look and feel of the iFrame. See [Optional Parameters](#Optional-Parameters), later in this guide, for detailed information on customizing the Hosted iFrame Tokenizer.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> To experiment with additional customizations, you can modify the sample page URL to add and remove parameters. 
>
> For example, to include Expiration Date and CVV fields on the [Default Implementation example](https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/outer-page.html), append `?useexpiry=true&usecvv=true` to the URL.

| Tokenizer Implementation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Default Implementation](https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/outer-page.html) | The default implementation with no optional parameters included.
| [CVV & Expiry Fields Enabled](https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/outer-page.html?useexpiry=true&usecvv=true) | The following optional parameters are used: <br> <br> `useexpiry=true` <br> `usecvv=true` |
| [CVV & Expiry Fields Enabled with Custom Input Field Labels](https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/outer-page.html?useexpiry=true&usecvv=true&cardlabel=Custom%20Card%20Number%20Label&expirylabel=Custom%20Expiration%20Date%20Label&cvvlabel=Custom%20CVV%20Label) | The following optional parameters are used: <br> <br> `useexpiry=true` <br> `usecvv=true` <br> `cardlabel=Custom Card Number Label` <br> `expirylabel=Custom Expiration Date Label` <br> `cvvlabel=Custom CVV Label` |
| [Mobile ACH Implementation](https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/outer-page.html?fullmobilekeyboard=true&tokenizewheninactive=true&inactivityto=2000) | The mobile ACH implementation enables the full mobile keyboard. This allows entry of the forward slash character that separates the routing number and bank account number. Additional parameters mask the bank account number after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) of inactivity. <br> <br> The following optional parameters are used: <br> <br> `fullmobilekeyboard=true` <br> `tokenizewheninactive=true` <br> `inactivityto=2000` |

# Implementing the Hosted iFrame Tokenizer

Embedding the Hosted iFrame Tokenizer into your web page requires:

- an HTML iframe element
- a hidden HTML input element
- a JavaScript event listener

<!-- theme: warning -->
> Additionally, we strongly recommend using [reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha) to prevent fraud and carding attacks performed by malicious software (also known as "bots"). 
> 
> For more information on preventing carding attacks, see our LaunchPointe article [here](https://cardconnect.com/launchpointe/payment-security/stay-protected-against-carding).

The iframe element loads the Hosted iFrame Tokenizer within your web page and displays the Card Number field for user input. By providing additional optional parameters, the iframe can also display input fields for expiration date and CVV.

The hidden HTML input element is used to store the tokenized payment data returned by the iFrame Tokenizer so that it can be used to authorize and capture a transaction using the CardPointe Gateway API.

The JavaScript event listener is triggered when the iFrame Tokenizer returns the payment token, and the script parses the response and stores the token in the hidden input field for use.

Each step in implementing the iFrame Tokenizer is covered in the basic HTML example below.

> Replace <site> in the URL with the appropriate site for your UAT or Production application. 

## Implementation Steps

**1.** Where the clear text credit card number is entered, place a reference to the embedded iframe page and style the iframe element on the primary payment page as needed.

#### Create HTML Form with Nested iFrame

```HTML
<form name="tokenform" id="tokenform">
    <iframe id="tokenFrame" name="tokenFrame" src="https://<site>.cardconnect.com/itoke/ajax-tokenizer.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</form>
```

**2.** On the primary payment page, place a hidden input field to store the token after it is generated within the iframe.

#### Append Hidden Input Field to Hold the Generated Token

```HTML
<form name="tokenform" id="tokenform">
    <iframe id="tokenFrame" name="tokenFrame" src="https://<site>.cardconnect.com/itoke/ajax-tokenizer.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
    <input type="hidden" name="mytoken" id="mytoken"/>
</form>
```

**3.** Attach a listener to detect when token generation is complete and assign the value to the input field above.

#### Include Javascript Event Listener in HTML Head

```JavaScript
<script language="JavaScript">
    window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
        var token = JSON.parse(event.data);
        var mytoken = document.getElementById('mytoken');
        mytoken.value = token.message;
    }, false);
</script>
```

The following HTML snippet shows key elements of the primary payment page.

#### Complete HTML Example

```HTML
<html>
<head>
<script language="JavaScript">
    window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
        var token = JSON.parse(event.data);
        var mytoken = document.getElementById('mytoken');
        mytoken.value = token.message;
    }, false);
</script>
</head>
<body>
    <form name="tokenform" id="tokenform">
        <iframe id="tokenFrame" name="tokenFrame" src="https://<site>.cardconnect.com/itoke/ajax-tokenizer.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
        <input type="hidden" name="mytoken" id="mytoken"/>
</form>
</body>
</html>
```

## Optional Parameters

You can customize aspects of the Hosted iFrame Tokenizer by including optional parameters that override the default configuration. Read through each of the sections below for an overview of the customization available.

Additionally, you can customize the style of the iFrame Tokenizer using the optional `css` parameter, which is not referenced in the sections below. View the [iFrame Styling](#iframe-styling) section for more information about customizing the appearance of the iFrame Tokenizer.

### iFrame Controls

The following parameters are used to override the default behavior, display, and response of the Hosted iFrame Tokenizer.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> If your web page might be accessed from a mobile device, you should add the `tokenizewheninactive` and `inactivityto` parameters.
>
> Additionally, if you accept ACH payments, include the `fullmobilekeyboard` parameter.

| Parameter Name | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| autofocus |	false |	If **true**, the input field will be focused when the page loads. |
| cardinputmaxlength | 2000	| Controls the maximum character limit for the card number field. |
| cardnumbernumericonly	| false	| If **true**, the card number input field ignores non-numeric values. |
| enhancedresponse	| false	| If **true**, the following additional parameters will be included in the JSON response after a tokenization attempt: <br> <br> **token** - the token if tokenization was successful, otherwise an empty string <br> **errorCode** - one of the following: <br> - The error code from CardSecure on tokenization failure <br> - A custom iFrame Tokenizer error code <br> - '0' if no error occurred <br> **errorMessage** - the error message from CardSecure on tokenization failure; otherwise, an empty string. <br> <br> See [Error Codes and Messages](?path=docs/APIs/CardSecureAPI.md) in the CardSecure API for detailed information. |
| fullmobilekeyboard | false | Displays a full alphanumeric keyboard in mobile web browsers (iOS and Android). This allows users to enter a forward slash (/) when entering an ACH routing/account number string. <br> <br> If **fullmobilekeyboard** is true, it changes the `type` attribute of the HTML input field to `'text'` which enables a full alphanumeric keyboard to be displayed in web browsers on iOS and Android. If **false** or not provided, the input field type is set to `'tel'`. <br> <br> Set to **true** if you want to allow your users to enter ACH input. |
| inactivityto	| 500	| Controls how long (in milliseconds) the page will wait after an `onInput` event before considering input complete. Applies to both `'tokenizewheninactive'` mode and to swipes with a USB device. |
| invalidcreditcardevent | false | **Note**: _This parameter should be used in place of_ `invalidinputevent` _when enabling the_ `usecvv` _or_ `useexpiry` _parameters_. <br> <br> If **true**, a `'message'` event is sent to the parent page when the iFrame determines that the value for the Card Number field is invalid or empty. <br> <br> The `'data'` property in the event will contain an empty string, and the `'validationError'` property will contain a description of the validation failure. <br> <br> An example of this event can viewed in the web browser's console on the following example page: <br> https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/outer-page.html?useexpiry=true&invalidcreditcardevent=true. |
| invalidcvvevent	| false |	If **true**, a `'message'` event is sent to the parent page when the iFrame determines that the value for the CVV field is invalid or empty. <br> <br> The `'data'` property in the event will contain an empty string, and the `'validationError'` property will contain a description of the validation failure. <br> <br> **Note**: _Requires_ `usecvv=true`. <br> <br> An example of this event can viewed in the web browser's console on the following example page: <br> https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/outer-page.html?usecvv=true&invalidcvvevent=true |
| invalidexpiryevent | false | If **true**, a `'message'` event is sent to the parent page when the iFrame determines that the value for the Expiration Date field is invalid or empty. <br> <br> The `'data'` property in the event will contain an empty string, and the `'validationError'` property will contain a description of the validation failure. <br> <br> **Note**: _Requires_ `useexpiry=true`. <br> <br> An example of this event can viewed in the web browser's console on the following example page: <br> https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/outer-page.html?useexpiry=true&invalidexpiryevent=true |
| invalidinputevent	| false |	**Note**: _This parameter should be used in place of_ `invalidcreditcardevent` _when your implementation only requires the Card Number field_. <br> <br> If **true**, a `'message'` event is sent to the parent page when the iFrame determines that the value for the Card Number field is invalid or empty. <br> <br> The `'data'` property in the event will contain an empty string, and the `'validationError'` property will contain a description of the validation failure. <br> <br> An example of this event can viewed in the web browser's console on the following example page: <br> https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/outer-page.html?invalidinputevent=true |
| orientation	| default |	Controls the orientation of the elements within the iFrame. <br> <br> Supported values are: <br> <br> **default** - the default orientation, used if no value is passed for this parameter. <br> **horizontal** <br> **vertical** <br> **custom** |
| selectinputdelay | 0 | **Note**: _This parameter is intended for iOS implementations where user input unexpectedly causes already populated fields to be cleared_. <br> <br> Controls how long (in milliseconds) to ignore input to a newly selected field after changing focus. The default value of 0 represents no delay in accepting input to a newly selected field, whereas the maximum value of 1000 represents a 1 second delay before accepting input to a newly selected field. A value of 100 is typically sufficient to avoid unintended clearing without interfering with the user experience. |
| sendcardtypingevent	| false |	If **true**, an event is sent to the parent page with `'cardTyping':true` when the user begins entering a value into the Card Number field. When an `onBlur` event occurs or the `inactivityto` value has been met, the card number value is submitted for tokenization and an event is sent to the parent page with `'cardTyping':false`. <br> <br> An example of this event can viewed in the web browser's console on the following example page: <br> https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/outer-page.html?sendcardtypingevent=true |
| swipeonly	| false	| If **true**, any input that has an input rate less than the `swiperate` threshold will be cleared out. <br> Set this to true if the iFrame is only beingused with USB keyboard devices and manual input is not permitted. |
| swiperate	| 0.2 | Defines the threshold for determining whether input is coming from a swipe on a USB device or a user typing on a keyboard. The default value of 0.2 represents .2 characters per millisecond, or 200 characters per second. The default should only be reduced if swipes are not being recognized correctly by the iFrame. |
| tokenizewheninactive | false | **Note**: _This parameter should be used for mobile implementations_. <br> <br> Validation and tokenization for manual input is normally performed when an `onBlur` event occurs on the input field (for example, when the user clicks/tabs to the next field in the form). If `'tokenizewheninactive'` is set to true, validation and tokenization will be performed once the input field stops receiving input from the user. This inactivity duration is configurable through the `'inactivityto'` parameter. Note that the `onBlur` event will not be used at all if `'tokenizewheninactive'` is set to true and that `'inactivityto'` is also used to determine when a swipe has completed. |
| tokenpropname |	message |	Controls the name of the token property in the JSON message that is sent to the parent page. <br> <br> This must be an alphanumeric value. |
| unique | false | If **true**, CardSecure generates a unique token for each tokenization of a given card number. |

### Input Placeholders

The following parameters are used to supply placeholder text displayed within the various input fields.

| Parameter Name | Default Value | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| placeholder	| none	| A string value to be used as placeholder text for the input field of the tokenizer, specified using the HTML input field's placeholder attribute. This feature is not supported on versions of Internet Explorer older than IE 10. <br> <br> Note the following restrictions when including a placeholder string: <br> <br> The string must be URL-encoded. <br> <br> Only the following characters are supported: <br> letters <br> numbers <br> spaces <br> symbols — !, #, $, %, &, *, +, -, _, =, ?, @, ], [, }, {, ), (, /, \, ^, ~, :, single-quote ('), double-quote ("), backtick (`), period (.), semi-colon (;), and comma (,) <br> limited international characters — Á, É, Í, Ñ, Ó, Ú, Ü, á, é, í, ñ, ó, ú, ü, â, ç, è, ê, î, ô, û, ã, õ, à, ä, ö, ß, ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, ё, й, ъ, ы, э, щ <br> <br> The maximum string length is 60 characters. |
| placeholdercvv | none	| A placeholder value to display in the CVV field. <br> <br> The placeholder value must be a 3 or 4-digit numeric value. |
| placeholdermonth	| none	| A placeholder value to display in the Month field, in the format MM. |
| placeholderyear | none | A placeholder value to display in the Year field, in the format YYYY. |

### Input Fields

The following parameters are used to enable additional input fields and options associated with those fields.

| Parameter Name | Default Value | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| monthnames | January-February-March-April-May-June-July-August-September-October-December	| A string value to be used as alternative labels for each month in the drop-down list. <br> <br> The alternative label for each month is separated by a hyphen, starting with the 1st month and ending with the 12th month. <br> <br> **Note**: _The alternative month labels are used only when_ `usemonthnames` _is_ **true**. |
| usecvv | false | If **true**, includes a field to enter the Cardholder Verification Value (CVV). <br> <br> **Notes**: <br> _If_ `usecvv` _is_ **_true_**, _the CVV must be provided to initiate the tokenization request._ <br> _CVV is not masked. This value remains in clear text._ <br> _The CVV is retained for a maximum of 2 minutes or the first use of the token, after which it is discarded._ |
| usemonthnames	| false	| If **true**, displays Month names instead of numbers. |
| useexpiry | false	| If **true**, includes two drop-down selectors to specify the expiration month (MM) and Year (YYYY). <br> <br> **Notes**:  <br> _If_ `useexpiry` _is_ **_true_**, _the expiration must be provided to initiate the tokenization request_. <br> _The expiry value is retained for a maximum of 2 minutes or the first use of the token, after which it is discarded_.
| useexpiryfield | false | If **true**, uses expiry entry fields instead of drop-down selectors. <br> <br> The Month field supports 2-digit month values from 1-12 (including support for leading zeros for single-digit months, for example "01"). <br> <br> The Year field supports a 4-digit year value within the next 20 years (including the current year). <br> <br> **Note**: _Requires_ `useexpiry=true`. |

### Input Formatting

The following fields are used to override the default formatting rules for text entered into the Card Number field.

| Parameter Name | Default Value | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| formatinput | false | Styles the card number to be separated every four numbers so the number is easily read as the user types into the field. |
| maskfirsttwo	| false	| If **true**, the first 2 digits of the card number are masked. |

### Input Labels

The following parameters are used to override the default labels and titles used to describe various input fields.

| Parameter Name | Default Value | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| cardlabel	| Card Number | Controls the text inside the label for the card number field. <br> <br> This label is only present when either `useexpiry` or `usecvv` are true. |
| cardtitle	| Credit Card Number | Controls the `title` and `aria-label` HTML attributes for the card number input field, for use by a screen reader application. |
| cvvlabel | CVV | Controls the text inside the label for the CVV field. <br> <br> The label is only present when `usecvv` is **true**. |
| cvvtitle | Card Verification Value | Controls the `title` and `aria-label` HTML attributes for the cvv input field, for use by a screen reader application. |
| expirylabel | Expiration Date	| Controls the text inside the label for the expiration date selectors. <br> <br> The label is only present when `useexpiry` is **true**. |
| expirymonthtitle | Expiration Month | Controls the `title` and `aria-label` HTML attributes for the expiry month field, for use by a screen reader application. |
| expiryyeartitle | Expiration Year | Controls the `title` and `aria-label` HTML attributes for the expiry year field, for use by a screen reader application. |

## iFrame Styling

You can use the `css` parameter to include CSS declarations in the iFrame SRC attribute, to customize the look and feel of the iFrame. The CSS parameter can also accept media queries, allowing for responsive design based on screen or window size. See [Allowed CCS Properties](#allowed-ccs-properties) below for a list of available properties.

For example, the following iFrame URL includes custom CSS properties to specify the error text color and input field width:

```HTML
<iframe id="tokenframe" name="tokenframe" src="https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/ajax-tokenizer.html?css=.error{color:%20red;}input{width:500px;}" scrolling="no" width="200" height="30" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

To prevent page rendering issues, you must URL encode the CSS property string, including curly braces ({}), to ensure that the characters and values in the string are handled correctly.

The following example includes the same CSS parameters as the example above, properly URL-encoded:

```HTML
<iframe id="tokenframe" name="tokenframe" src="https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/ajax-tokenizer.html?css=%2Eerror%7Bcolor%3A%20red%3B%7Dinput%7Bwidth%3A500px%3B%7D" scrolling="no" width="200" height="30" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

<!-- theme: danger -->
> Failure to properly URL encode all special characters within the iFrame URL can cause page rendering issues and other disruptions.

### Allowed CCS Properties

Any of the following CSS properties can be used when passing CSS declarations using the `css` parameter.

When the `css` parameter contains CSS properties that are not included in the allowed list below, those properties are ignored.

## RSA Encryption

The Hosted iFrame Tokenizer supports RSA encryption to encrypt account data before sending the tokenize request to CardSecure.

The Hosted iFrame Tokenizer checks for an RSA key pair for your configuration, and if present retrieves the public key and encrypts the data during the tokenization request to CardSecure. You can use the browser's developer tools to verify that the data is encrypted using your RSA key.

If you do not have a CardSecure RSA key pair already generated, the iFrame Tokenizer will fail to obtain a public key for encryption and you will encounter a `'No public key found'` error when viewing the request within the browser's developer tools. You can disregard this error, as the iFrame Tokenizer continues to transmit the account data over a secure connection to CardSecure.

> If you want to use RSA encryption, contact CardPointe Support to get started.

## Luhn/Mod 10 Validation

By default, the Card Number field is validated using the [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm), and is automatically assigned an HTML class where `class="error"` when the value does not pass validation. This error class contains no CSS declarations, and has no visible effect unless your implementation includes custom CSS.

Use the optional `css` parameter to pass custom CSS declarations for the error class, which are then applied only when the Card Number value is determined to be invalid. Remember to URL encode the string passed to the `css` parameter as required.

An example containing custom CSS for the error class is provided below for reference. The `css` parameter contains style declarations for the error class that result in the Card Number field turning red when the value does not pass Luhn validation.

**Incorrect**: `https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/ajax-tokenizer.html?css=.error{color:red;border-color:red;}`

**Correct**: `https://fts-uat.cardconnect.com/itoke/ajax-tokenizer.html?css=.error%7Bcolor%3Ared%3Bborder-color%3Ared%3B%7D`

<!-- theme: danger -->
> Note that the string passed to the `css` paramater **must** be URL-encoded in order for the CSS to be parsed correctly. Failure to URL encode the string may cause page rendering issues and other disruptions.

## ACH/eCheck Tokenization

The Hosted iFrame Tokenizer can accept entry of electronic check or ACH details in order to retrieve a token that can then be submitted within an [ACH Authorization](?path=docs/documentation/CardPointeGatewayDeveloperGuides.md#processing-ach-payments).

When using the iFrame Tokenizer to tokenize ACH account data, you must input the routing and account numbers in a single string, separated by a forward slash (/). Use the following format: `RoutingNumber/AccountNumber`.

Example: `123456789/1234123412341234`

> Include `fullmobilekeyboard=true` in the URL string to display the full keyboard on mobile devices. This allows mobile device users to enter a forward slash (/) in the input field.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> Alternatively, you can develop a custom form that allows your users to enter the routing and account numbers in separate fields.
>
> See [Processing ACH Payments](?path=docs/documentation/CardPointeGatewayDeveloperGuides.md#processing-ach-payments) in the [CardPointe Gateway Developer Guides](?path=docs/documentation/CardPointeGatewayDeveloperGuides.md) for more information on handling ACH requests.

## Supporting Screen Readers

Screen readers enable blind and visually impaired users to interact with a web page using non-visual means, such as text-to-speech dictation of page elements.

The Card Number, Expiry, and CVV field elements include title tags to enable compatibility with screen reader applications. 

The default title values are:

- **Credit Card Number** - "Credit Card Number"
- **Expiry Month** - "Expiration Month"
- **Expiry Year** - "Expiration Year"
- **CVV** - "Card Verification Value"

You can use the following URL parameters to customize the default titles:

| Parameter	| Type	| Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cardtitle	| AN | A meaningful custom title for the card number field.
| expirymonthtitle	| AN | A meaningful custom title for the expiry month field.
| expiryyeartitle | AN | A meaningful custom title for the expiry year field.
| cvvtitle	| AN | A meaningful custom title for the cvv field.

# Integrating a Card Reader Device

Certain use cases may benefit from using a card reader device with the Hosted iFrame Tokenizer.

Using an encrypted card reader device to capture and pass card data to the iFrame Tokenizer electronically may help to reduce your PCI scope in some instances. The following plug-and-play USB devices are available for use with CardSecure and the iFrame Tokenizer:

<!-- theme: warning -->
> The CardPointe Desktop SDK provides a P2PE-validated, plug-and-play EMV (chip) and MSR (magstripe) card reader integration for the Hosted iFrame Tokenizer. See the [CardPointe Desktop Developer Guide](?path=docs/documentation/CardPointeDesktopSDKDeveloperGuide.md) for more information.
