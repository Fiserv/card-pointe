# CoPilot API Overview

The CoPilot API uses JSON web service semantics and provides resources for boarding new merchant accounts and managing existing accounts. 

The API complements the CoPilot web application, offering a programmatic interface to some features available in the application; however, you must use the web application to complete some tasks (for example, creating application templates).

## Date Updated: 4/16/2024 

An update to the CoPilot API has been released to the Production environment on 4/16/2024. This release includes the following update in addition to internal fixes and enhancements:

### New Delivery Percentages Field

The **Delivery Percentages** object now includes a **dlvrySameDayPct** field to specify the percentage of orders that the merchant fulfills same-day, represented as a whole number.

The following example illustrates a possible entry including the new field:

```
"deliveryPercentages": {
    "dlvrySameDayPct": 96,
    "dlvry0To7DaysPct": 1,
    "dlvry8To14DaysPct": 1,
    "dlvry15To30DaysPct": 1,
    "dlvryOver30DaysPct": 1
}
```

The addition of this field aligns with the same-day delivery option being made available to newly created accounts in CoPilot and the Digital Application. For more information on this, please refer to the CardPointe Support Site. 

## Date Updated: 11/8/2023 

An update to the CoPilot API has been released to the Production environment on 11/8/2023. This release includes the following updates in addition to internal fixes and enhancements:

### Enhanced Field Validation 

Additional validations have been incorporated for the `legalBusinessName`, `akaBusinessName`, `taxFilingName`, and `dbaName` fields to check for string sizes that exceed the expected maximum length. The following example illustrates two possible errors:

```
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "code": "1105",
            "message": "Legal Business Name has invalid length.",
            "errorfield": "merchant.legalBusinessName",
            "status": "BAD_REQUEST"
        },
        {
            "code": "1178",
            "message": "AKA Business Name has invalid length.",
            "errorfield": "merchant.akaBusinessName",
            "status": "BAD_REQUEST"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Shipping Bill To Field 

Previously, the Shipping Bill To field was not pulled from the template. However, it is now automatically provided from the active template. There is no need to utilize the `shippingBillToCd` field in the API, and if it is used, it will be disregarded.

### Non-Swiped Auth Fee 

`cloverNonSwipedAuthFee` has been added to the fee class. This fee is only applicable for North Retail ISO merchants.

# Getting Started

## Authentication

The CoPilot API uses the Bearer Authentication HTTP authentication scheme in order to authenticate requests to the API. 

To obtain a bearer token to authenticate your API requests, you must create a CoPilot user in the CoPilot web application then provide that user's username and password in a request to the CoPilot API's Token endpoint. A successful request returns a JSON Web Token (JWT) which you use as the Bearer token in subsequent calls to the CoPilot API.

<!-- theme: danger -->
> We **strongly recommend** that you create a dedicated CoPilot user to authenticate your CoPilot API requests, and that you do not use this account to access the CoPilot web application.
>
> The CoPilot web application uses two-factor authentication (2FA); attempting to log into the web application with your CoPilot API user will initiate the 2FA requirement for this user, preventing it from authenticating API requests until the 2FA requirement is satisfied in the web application.

## Versioning

Whenever possible, newer versions of the API will be backwards compatible with older versions. To ensure your integration is not disrupted in the event that backwards compatibility cannot be maintained, we **strongly recommend** specifying the version in the header of each API request as part of your integration. This is accomplished by supplying the `X-CopilotAPI-Version` HTTP header with the value of the version your application uses.

### Example Header 

```
Authorization: Bearer accessTokenValue
Content-type: application/json
X-CopilotAPI-Version: 1.0
```

> - This header should be omitted from requests to the Token endpoint, as authentication via the Token endpoint occurs independently of the CoPilot API.
> - The current version of the CoPilot API is 1.0.
