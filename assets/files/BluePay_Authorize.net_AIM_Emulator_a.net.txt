BluePay Authorize.net AIM Emulator (a.net)

Updated: 2015-08-19

Note: This emulator only emulates Authorize.net AIM NVP (Name Value Pairs). Authorize.net CIM and AIM XML are not supported.

To use BluePay's Authorize.net AIM emulator, you must:

1) Replace the URL
https://secure.authorize.net/gateway/transact.dll
with
https://secure.bluepay.com/gateway/transact.dll
or
https://secure.bluepay.com/interfaces/a.net

2) Input your 12-digit BluePay ACCOUNT ID where the Authorize.net username (x_Login) would normally go.

3) Input your 32-character BluePay SECRET KEY where the Authorize.net key or password (x_tran_key or x_password) would normally go.  In some cases your system may only accept 16 digits in this field; in that case use the first 16 characters of the SECRET KEY.


To find your ACCOUNT ID and SECRET KEY:

1) Log into the BluePay gateway ( https://secure.bluepay.com ).
2) From the left side menu choose ADMIN>Accounts>List. 
3) In the list click the account name.
4) On the Account Admin page the ACCOUNT ID and the SECRET KEY will be displayed.


Test Transactions
Setting x_test_request=True or using the URL https://secure.bluepay.com/interfaces/a.net.test will cause a transaction to be treated as a test transaction. The results of a test transaction are determined by the dollar amount of the transaction without cents. If the dollar amount is odd an approval is returned. If the dollar amount is even a decline is returned.
