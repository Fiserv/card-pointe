# BluePay  2.0 "Batch Upload" Interface

Last Update: 2020-10-29

# Description

This interface is intended to be used by a merchant to upload a batch of transactions.

There are two versions of the output of this API. Version 1 receives a upload, imports it and 
responds with the result of the import. Version 2 does the same but sends characters in the 
DOTS field to keep the connection open during  import. This may be necessary when a large 
number of transactions are being uploaded.

The URLs of this interface are currently:
Version 1: https://secure.bluepay.com/interfaces/bp20bu
Version 2: https://secure.bluepay.com/interfaces/bp20bu.v2
           Or
           https://secure.bluepay.com/interfaces/bp20bu 
           with "X-Bluepay-response-version: 2" included in the HTTP header.

# Input format

Input to this web service utilizes an HTTP "POST" style interface.
The headers must be set specifically as such:
1) Content-type: Must include the letters "csv" as in "text/csv" or whatever.
2) Content-length: Must be present and indicate the number of bytes in the body
3) X-BluePay-account: Must be present and include the 12-digit BluePay account ID
4) X-BluePay-key: Contains the 32-character secret key
5) X-BluePay-mode: TEST or LIVE
6) X-Bluepay-ignore-parser-errors: 1 or 0 (Optional) When enabled parser will continue to 
                                   process file after an error is encountered.
 
The body of the POST contains the contents of the batch upload CSV file. The first line must 
contain all of the field names used throughout the remainder of the file.

For example:
"payment_acc","card_expire","amount","trans_type"
"4111111111111111","0110","1.00","SALE"
"4782000000000006","0609","3.00","SALE"

# Output format

Output will be in the immediate response to the POST. The body of the response will contain 
the output parameters and values in a URI-encoded format.

You can also be notified via BluePay's notification system. The notification system will 
notify the merchant via email(default) or can POST to a CGI on the merchant's server.
